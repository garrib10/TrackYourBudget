# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

For this assignment, we were told to make a Budget Tracker application that has online and offline access and funcitionality. When the application is deployed you are able to add expenses and deposit your budget that seems fit. Then you are able to go offline using the dev tool network tab and add in a new expense and it would show up when you change back to online accessiblitiy. Finally, this application will be delpoyed using Heroku. 

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
